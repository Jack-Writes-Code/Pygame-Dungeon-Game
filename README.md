# Pygame-Dungeon-Game

This was a project I built as a learning experience for Pygame as well as for fun.

It's a 'Zelda-Like' micro game where you walk between rooms, gather treasure and fight enemies.

WASD / Arrow keys to move, Space to Attack.

Includes a compiled EXE version so you can just play it. Credits for artwork/sounds given within relevant classes in the code.


This is NOT a maintained project and is available publicly only for others to play with and view the code, if it can help them in any way.
